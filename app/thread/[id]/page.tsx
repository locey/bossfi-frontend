I've been researching for weeks now, reading articles, watching videos, but everything seems so complicated. I'm looking for a simple, straightforward explanation that doesn't require a PhD in computer science.

What I understand so far:
- Crypto = digital money?
- NFTs = digital art ownership?

But I feel like I'm missing something fundamental. Can anyone help clarify this for a complete beginner?`,
